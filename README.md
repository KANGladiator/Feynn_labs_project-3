# Project on Machine Performance Monitoring
### - by Kanishk Singh

## Introduction

This project aims to oversee machine performance by employing various methods in machine learning. The goal is to scrutinize sensor data from machines, detect irregularities, and provide insights into their overall condition and effectiveness.

## Key Elements


- Exploration of Data: Investigate and visualize sensor data to understand machine behavior and patterns.

- Data Preparation: Refine and preprocess data to prepare it for machine learning model training.

- Machine Learning Techniques: Construct and train models for anomaly detection, prediction of machine failures, and assessment of overall performance.


## Instructions

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook following the setup instructions provided in the Installation section.

2. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially.

3. Utilize comments and documentation within the notebook to comprehend each step and make necessary adjustments.

4. Analyze the results and visual representations to interpret the machine's performance status.
