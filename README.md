# Machine Health Monitoring

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on monitoring the health of machines using various machine learning techniques. The project aims to analyze sensor data from machines, detect anomalies, and provide insights into the overall health of the machines.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Explore and visualize the sensor data to gain insights into the machine's behavior and patterns.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for machine learning model training.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and train machine learning models for anomaly detection, predicting machine failures, and assessing overall health.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using the steps mentioned in the Installation section.

2. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.

3. Follow the comments and documentation within the notebook to understand each step and make necessary adjustments.

4. Analyze the results and visualizations to interpret the machine health status.
